# Module 5 Challenge Summary: Evaluating SCC Treatment with Capomulin by Pymaceuticals Inc.

## Study Objective
Pymaceuticals Inc. conducted a study to evaluate Capomulin, a new treatment for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a prevalent form of skin cancer. The aim was to compare the efficacy of Capomulin against other drug regimens used in treating SCC in mice.

## Data Location and Analysis Tools
All relevant data, including raw mouse data and study results, are maintained in the designated Pymaceuticals data repository. Detailed analyses are documented under the project name 'pymaceuticals_capomulin'.

## Comprehensive Analysis Overview
The analytical process encompassed several critical evaluations:
- Consolidation of mouse and study data into a single dataset.
- Calculation of summary statistics for tumor volume across various drug regimens.
- Visualization through bar charts to compare the frequency of data points across drug treatments.
- Pie chart depiction of the gender distribution among the study mice.
- Detailed outlier analysis for treatment groups including Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin.
- Box plots to illustrate the final tumor volumes across key treatment groups.
- A line graph tracking tumor volume changes over time for a mouse treated with Capomulin.
- A scatter plot correlating average tumor volume with mouse weight within the Capomulin group.
- Application of Pearson’s correlation coefficient and a linear regression model to explore the relationship between tumor volume and mouse weight for the Capomulin-treated mice.

This structured approach enabled a thorough evaluation of Capomulin’s effectiveness against SCC, providing clear, actionable insights.
